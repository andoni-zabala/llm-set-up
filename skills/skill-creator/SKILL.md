## When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when:
- A pattern is used repeatedly and AI needs guidance
- Project-specific conventions differ from generic best practices
- Complex workflows need step-by-step instructions
- Decision trees help AI choose the right approach

**Don't create a skill when:**
- Documentation already exists (create a reference instead)
- Pattern is trivial or self-explanatory
- It's a one-off task

---

## Skill Structure

```
skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md              # Required - main skill file
├── assets/               # Optional - templates, schemas, examples
│   ├── template.rb
│   └── schema.json
└── references/           # Optional - links to local docs
    └── docs.md
```

## SKILL.md Template

```markdown

name: {skill-name}
description: >
  {One-line description of what this skill does}.
  Trigger: {When the AI should load this skill}.

## When to Use

{Bullet points of when to use this skill}

## Critical Patterns

{The most important rules - what AI MUST know}

## Code Examples

{Minimal, focused examples}

## Commands

```bash
{Common commands}
```
```

---

## Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| Generic skill | `{technology}` | `rspec`, `ruby-sorbet`, `rails-8` |
| Project-specific | `{project}-{component}` | `myapp-api`, `myapp-test` |
| Workflow skill | `{action}-{target}` | `skill-creator` |

---

## Content Guidelines

### DO
- Start with the most critical patterns
- Use tables for decision trees
- Keep code examples minimal and focused
- Include Commands section with copy-paste commands

### DON'T
- Duplicate content from existing docs (reference instead)
- Include lengthy explanations (link to docs)
- Add troubleshooting sections (keep focused)

---

## Registering the Skill

After creating the skill, add it to `AGENTS.md`:

1. Add to the skills table:
```markdown
| `{skill-name}` | {Description} | [SKILL.md](skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md) |
```

2. Add to the auto-invoke table if applicable:
```markdown
| {Action that triggers it} | `{skill-name}` |
```
